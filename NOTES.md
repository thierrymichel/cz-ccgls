# Notes

> If emoji can not start the headline (to follow the specs), what about splitting type and gitmoji ?
> And just keeping the autocomplete ?â€¦and/or grouping them? [choose a visual description]

- [ ] fetch from gitmoji repo
- [ ] use cache?
- [ ] commit message length ? (max 100)
- [ ] add `imp` for `improvement` to [types](conventional-commit-types)
- [ ] add gitmoji autocomplete for commit message?
- [ ] is it possible to put gitmoji first? (being compliant with `conventionalCommits` tools)
